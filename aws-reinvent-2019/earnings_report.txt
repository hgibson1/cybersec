Someone accessed our quarterly earnings report in S3 and leaked it to the media. Luckily, we have object logging turned on.

We've been able to narrow the leak down to sometime on September 3, 2019. Inspect the logs and find out who leaked the report.

The answer is the name of the user who accessed the earning report data.

S3 bucket name: mod-module-1-earningsreportbucket-1cco3huquiaw7

Access trail name: mod-module-1-EarningsReportAccessTrail-FI00URKWZTKT
